🖥️NCF-Meet

   Organizations are having a lot of issues with data security, particularly with web2 online
meeting systems. Numerous vulnerabilities in web2 meeting platforms might compromise the
confidentiality of important and sensitive information held by the organization. It's likely that the
centralized service providers gather a lot of information about their customers, such as IP
addresses, device details, and meeting metadata. The movements and online activities of users can
be monitored using this data. Additionally, these established platforms previously had weaknesses
in security that might have given hackers access to users' devices and meetings. and numerous
other problems, such as a deficiency in customization.
  
   We suggest a method that takes into account, ranks, and resolves the shortcomings of the
Web2 meeting platforms. Our web/mobile application's main goals are to increase data integrity,
safeguard sensitive information, and create a tamper-proof meeting atmosphere by utilizing
blockchain capabilities. We also hope to personalize user experiences by utilizing AI features.
   
   In a time when online meeting security is crucial, customers can rely on our app NCF (Non
Centralized Future) to prioritize data privacy and confidentiality, giving them peace of mind. This
platform is designed with an organization in mind, removing the need for them to rely on a third-
party, centralized system that may have data loss.
